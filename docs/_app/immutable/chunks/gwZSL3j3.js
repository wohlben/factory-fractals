Relatively narrower oceans may facilitate their ability to communicate, while denser seismic zones may make them more inclined to cooperate with each other. Upon the arrival of our mecha, we will probably encounter a class I-II civilization that is already reasonably developed. If we can gain their cooperation, it will save Icarus from many of the most tedious processes involved in the early development of an industrial system, and unify the local stellar system’s resources when progressing the Dyson Sphere program.\\\\r\\\\nSparing a thought for the borderline unimaginable situation that \\"there is no indigenous civilization on a Mariterra planet\\", COSMO is working
